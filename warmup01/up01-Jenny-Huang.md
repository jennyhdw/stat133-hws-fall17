Cooking Recipe
==============

My favorite breakfast recipe is **egg benedict** even though I have never given it a try.
In order to make it, you need the following ingredients:

-   4 eggs
-   2 English muffins
-   Butter
-   2 teaspoons white or rice vinegar
-   2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish
-   8 pieces of bacon or 4 pieces of Canadian bacon  

You will also need the following utensils:

-   A skillet
-   Tongs or a fork

### Instructions

1.  **Cook the bacon**: Heat a large skillet on medium low heat. Add the strips of bacon or the slices of Canadian bacon.
2.  **Bring poaching water to a simmer**: While the bacon is cooking, bring a large saucepan two-thirds-filled with water to a boil, then add the vinegar.
3.  **Make Hollandaise sauce in blender**: To make blender hollandaise, melt 10 Tbsp unsalted butter. Put 3 egg yolks, a tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender, blend on medium to medium high speed for 20-30 seconds, until eggs lighten in color. Transfer it to a container you can use for pouring and set it on a warm—but not hot—place on or near the stovetop.
4.  **Poach the eggs**: Essentially, working one egg at a time you crack an egg into a small bowl and slip it into the barely simmering water. Once it begins to solidify, you can slip in another egg, until you have all four cooking. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and let sit for 4 minutes. (Remember which egg went in first, you'll want to take it out first.) When it comes time to remove the eggs, gently lift out with a slotted spoon.
5.  **Toast English muffins**: As soon as all the eggs are in the poaching water, begin toasting your English muffins. If you can’t get all the muffins toasted by the time the eggs are ready, gently remove the eggs from the poaching water and set in a bowl.
6.  **Assemble your Eggs Benedict**: To assemble, butter one side of an English muffin. Top with two slices of bacon or 1 slice of Canadian bacon. You can trim the bacon to fit the muffin if you’d like. Put a poached egg on top of the bacon, then pour some hollandaise over. Sprinkle some parsley over it all and serve at once.

This recipe is good for *all year round*, and use it when you are feeling a nice breakfast with your significant others, friends, or families. Egg benedict is not that difficult to make and it is a fun twist of hard-boiled egg or sunny-side up.

Quadratic Equation
==================

A quadratic equation is in the form of

> *a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0

where x represents an unknown, and *a*,*b*, and *c* represent known numbers such that *a* is not equal to 0. If *a = 0*, then the equation is linear, not quadratic. The numbers *a*,*b*, and *c* are the coefficients of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term. The quadratic formula for the roots of the general quadratic equation is as below:

> $x = \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

``` r
a <- c(3,4,5)
matrix(data = a, nrow=3, ncol=1) 
```

    ## [2,]    4
    ## [3,]    5

Comments and Reflections
========================

-   Remembering the syntax was hard, especially the ones for formulas and equations.This is my first time using markdown. While it is pretty intuitive for most of the part, syntax is a big problem for me. Another difficulty is to construct a table, since we didn't do it in class, and all the tutorials on the internet use some sort of dataset that I'm no sure how to access. I asked my friends for help and also used Google too look up a lot of basic R languages. It took me around 3 hours to finish.
