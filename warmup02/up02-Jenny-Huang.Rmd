```{r}

load("nba2017-salary-points.RData")
ls()
```

```{r}
# quantitative variable
summary(salary)
summary(experience)
summary(points)
summary(points1)
summary(points2)
summary(points3)
```

```{r}
mean(salary)
sd(salary)
max(salary)
min(salary)
median(salary)
quantile(salary)
hist(salary)
boxplot(salary)
plot(density(salary))

```{r}
is.factor(position)
position_fac <- factor(position)
table(position_fac)
prop.table(table(position_fac))
```
There is a pretty even distribution across all the positions.
```{r}
barplot(prop.table(table(position_fac)))
```

## Reflections

I feel like this assignment is easier than the last one in the sense that it is much more intuitive/mathematical. I think the hard part is the difference between vector and factor, and really understand why we are using them.
