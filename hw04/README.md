# HW04 - Grades Visualizer

In this assignment, I'll be working on a data set containing raw scores of fictious students in a hypothetical Stat 133 course. 

From the user point of view, the main deliverable will be a shiny app to visualize: 1) the overall grade distribution, 2) the distribution and summary statistics of various scores, and 3) the relationships between pairs of scores.

From the developer point of view, there will be a number of functions that help to process the data, and compute the required statistics. In addition, there will be unit tests for the programmed functions, which is an essential part of any programming task.


library(shiny)

#run an app from a subdirectory in the repo
runGitHub("stat133-hws-fall17","jennyhdw",subdir = "hw04/app")


## Reflections and Comments
-Yes, this was my first time writing unit tests
-0, the logic of testthat is really straightforward and easy to learn
-Yes, this was my first time working with ggvis
-1, although it is different from the other graphing packagages, fundamentally they all work the same way and ggvis is more simple in my opinion that it guesses the kind of graph to plot.
-Yes, this was my first time working with conditional panels in shiny
-7,
-I like ggplot the most because it is the most straightforward in my opinion
-Yes, I went to office hours and also got help from my classmates
-Around 10 hours
-Shiny app was the most confusing part
